# AlgoScape

View the live demo [here.](https://algoscape.netlify.app)

This is an interactive algorithm visualizer that allows you to see first-hand how these algorithms look step-by-step.
The algorithms implemented include:

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path
- A\* Search

This currently does not work on mobile devices so please open on your computer.

I had a lot of fun building this project. Not only did this help me strengthen my web development knowledge, but I was able to througouhly understand many of the implemented algorithms on a micro scale. My grasp on data structures and algorithms is much stronger due to building this.

## Build Setup

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager.

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ pnpm install

# Serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ pnpm dev

# Build for production and launch server
$ pnpm build
$ pnpm preview # Use preview instead of start for Nuxt 3

# Generate static project
$ pnpm generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com).
